Anomaly Detection
[x] Remove alpha channel
[x] Do normalization in preprocessing
[x] Implement threshold for patient diagnosis (ROC curve)
[x] Make model bigger (+layers, +neurons)
[] Do grid search using CV to find best parameters in AE (lr, weight decay, dropout)
[] Do train/test split for patch clas threshold (find tresh with train, evaluate on test)
[] Do train/test split for patient diag threshold (find tresh with Cropped, evaluate on Holdout)
[] Try alternative approach: train AE, remove decoder and train classifier with input the bottleneck (or train all together?)
