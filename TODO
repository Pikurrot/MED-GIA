Anomaly Detection
[] Remove alpha channel
[] Do normalization in preprocessing
[] Implement threshold for patient diagnosis (ROC curve)
[] Make model bigger (+layers, +neurons)
[] Use pretrained model and finetune it (maybe we can take resnet except last classification layer and use it as encoder,
	then freeze it and train a decoder, or not freeze and let it finetune)
[] Do grid search to find best parameters
