Anomaly Detection
[x] Remove alpha channel
[] Do normalization in preprocessing
[] Implement threshold for patient diagnosis (ROC curve)
[] Make model bigger (+layers, +neurons)
[] Use pretrained model and finetune it (maybe we can take resnet except last classification layer and use it as encoder,
	then freeze it and train a decoder, or not freeze and let it finetune)
[] Do grid search to find best parameters


Questions:
- is resnet finetunning a good approach?
- how to do ROC curve with threshold once we have the red fractions
- when do we use HoldOut dataset
- Use MSE or another? (Structural Similarity Loss (SSIM))
- Makes sense using a VAE?
